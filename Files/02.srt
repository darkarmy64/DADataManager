1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,230
As you come into this world,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,550
something else is also born.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,950
RUMBLING

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,630
You begin your life, and
it begins a journey...

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,270
towards you.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,480
It moves slowly, but it never stops.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,710
Wherever you go, whatever path you take,

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,150
it will follow.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,320
Never faster, never slower, always coming.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,510
You will run.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,190
It will walk.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,310
You will rest.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,240
It will not.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,640
One day, you will linger
in the same place too long.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,310
You will sit too still
or sleep too deep...

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,600
.. and when, too late, you rise to go...

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,630
.. you will notice a
second shadow next to yours.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,520
Your life will then be over.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,520
GASPING

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,920
HE COUGHS AND GASPS FOR AIR

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
RAVEN CAWS

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,390
If you think because
she is dead, I am weak,

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,750
then you understand very little.

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,150
If you were any part of killing
her, and you're not afraid,

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,510
then you understand nothing at all.

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,550
So, for your own sake, understand this.

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,590
I am the Doctor.

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,110
I'm coming to find you,

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,830
and I will never, ever stop.

30
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,430
The equipment in that room is consistent

31
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,640
with an augmented ultra
long-range teleport.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,030
So, I'm not more than a single
light year from where I was,

33
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,880
and I'm in the same time zone.

34
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,470
When the sun sets, I'll be able
to establish an exact position

35
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,820
by the stars. Then you'll have a choice.

36
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,990
Come out, show yourself,

37
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,110
or keep on hiding.

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,710
Clara said I shouldn't take revenge.

39
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,800
You should know, I don't always listen.

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,620
Oh, what's this?

41
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,740
Well, are you gardeners? I hate gardening!

42
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,880
What sort of a person has a
power complex about flowers?

43
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,750
It's dictatorship for inadequates.

44
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,430
Or to put it another
way, it's dictatorship.

45
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,030
Come on! Chop, chop!

46
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,270
The Doctor will see you now!

47
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,150
Show me what you've got!

48
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,190
I just watched my best friend die in
agony. My day can't get any worse.

49
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,950
Let's see what we can do about yours!

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,880
STATIC HISSES

51
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
LOUD THUMP

52
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,670
THUMPING FOOTSTEPS

53
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,000
FOOTSTEPS GET LOUDER

54
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,160
FLIES BUZZ

55
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,080
FLIES BUZZ

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,540
HE GROANS

57
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,790
I know you.

58
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,590
I've seen you before!

59
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,110
I used to know a trick, back
when I was young and telepathic.

60
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,950
Clearly, you can't make an
actual psychic link with a door,

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,750
for one very obvious reason --

62
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,710
they're notoriously cross.

63
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,990
I mean, imagine life as a door.
People keep pushing past you.

64
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,150
All of that knocking,
but it's never for you.

65
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,990
And you get locked up every night,

66
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,920
so if you're just a little bit nice...

67
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,790
LOCK CLICKS

68
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,510
See, Clara?

69
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,480
Still got it.

70
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,700
But I... [HE MURMURS]

71
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,120
Um...

72
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,910
I can't actually see a way out of this...

73
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,080
I've finally run out of corridor.
There's a life summed up.

74
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,110
Now, this is new. I'm scared.

75
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,390
I just realised that I'm
actually scared of dying.

76
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,630
CLANG

77
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,550
SILENCE

78
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Something I said?

79
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,860
What did I say?

80
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,750
Why did you stop?

81
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,830
CREAKING

82
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,040
LOUD CRASHING AND RUMBLING

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
SPRINGS CREAK

84
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,310
- Old. Very old.
- FOOTSTEPS THUMP

85
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,830
Possibly very, very old.

86
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,520
FLY BUZZES

87
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,150
When I was a very little boy,
there was an old lady who died.

88
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,630
They covered her in veils, but it was
a hot, sunny day, and the flies came.

89
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,120
It gave me nightmares for years. So,
who's been stealing my nightmares?

90
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,870
What am I here for?

91
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,680
You've known about me for
a very long time, right?

92
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,880
So, what is it?

93
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,590
Is it a trap?

94
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,270
Is it a prison?

95
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,520
No!

96
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,310
Is it a torture chamber?

97
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,030
Am I right?

98
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,630
Somebody really should know better.

99
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,310
Anyone who can put all of this
together and steal my bad dreams,

100
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,830
they should know better.

101
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,790
The secrets I have -- no chance.

102
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,980
No telling, not me.

103
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,070
I told you I was scared of
dying. And I wasn't lying either.

104
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,060
Advantage -- me!

105
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,180
Because you won't see THIS coming!

106
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,110
Sorry, I'm late! Jumped out of a window.

107
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,350
Certain death. Don't you
want to know how I survived?

108
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Go on. Ask me!

109
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,110
No, of course I had to jump!

110
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,350
The first rule of being interrogated

111
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,110
is that you are the
only irreplaceable person

112
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,630
in the torture chamber.

113
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,430
The room is yours, so work it.

114
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,470
If they're going to
threaten you with death,

115
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,030
show them who's boss. Die faster!

116
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,390
You've seen me do that
more often than most.

117
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,910
Isn't that right, Clara?

118
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,150
Rule one of dying -- don't.

119
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,470
Rule two -- slow down.

120
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,630
You've got the rest of your life.

121
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,950
The faster you think,
the slower it will pass.

122
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,440
Concentrate! Assume you're going
to survive. Always assume that.

123
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,790
Imagine you've already survived.

124
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,550
There's a storm room in your mind.

125
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,630
Lock the door and think!

126
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,350
This is my storm room.

127
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,550
I always imagine that I'm
back in my Tardis, showing off,

128
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,550
telling you how I escaped,

129
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,950
making you laugh.

130
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,630
That's what I'm doing right now.

131
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,880
I am falling, Clara.

132
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,520
I'm dying.

133
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,520
And I'm going to explain
to you how I survived.

134
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,030
I can't wait to hear what I say.

135
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,020
I'm nothing without an audience.

136
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,070
BOOMING

137
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,550
One hope -- salt!

138
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,710
Thought I smelled it earlier. When
I broke the window, I was sure.

139
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,350
Salty air. This castle
is standing in the sea.

140
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,550
Diving into water from a great
height is no guarantee of survival.

141
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,350
I need to know exactly how far
I'm going to fall, and how fast.

142
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,600
Why do you think I threw the stool?

143
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,670
Fall time to impact...

144
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,470
- DISTANT SPLASH
- '.. seven seconds.'

145
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,430
Because you won't see this coming!

146
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,510
The wind resistance of the stool,

147
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,100
the atmospheric density...

148
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,430
.. the strength of the local gravity.

149
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,790
Am I spoiling the magic? I
work at this stuff, you know?

150
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,780
Should hit the water in about...

151
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,830
.. 0.02 seconds.

152
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,870
The chances of remaining conscious are...

153
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,000
LOUD SPLASH

154
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,910
CHALK TAPS ON CHALKBOARD

155
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,820
Can't I just sleep?

156
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,200
CHALK TAPS

157
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,030
Do I have to know everything?

158
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,040
CHALK TAPS

159
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,550
Clara, I can't always...

160
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,470
CHALK TAPS

161
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,880
ECHOING SCREECHES

162
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,710
HE BREATHES DEEPLY

163
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,320
BOOTS SQUELCH

164
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,680
BREATHING

165
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,430
It keeps coming, Clara.

166
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,710
Wherever I go, it follows. Why?

167
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,760
- Why does it do that?
- CHALK TAPS

168
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,870
Always the teacher. What's
the right question, then?

169
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
TAPPING

170
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,030
It's following me.

171
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,580
Wherever I go, it's tracking me.

172
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,600
Slowly though. Scary lurching.

173
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,060
Scary!

174
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,870
These screens everywhere...

175
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,990
It's showing me exactly
where it is all the time,

176
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,640
how far it's got, how near.

177
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,300
Because it's trying to scare me!

178
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,030
Putting its breath on my neck.

179
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,830
That's the point! That's what
it's doing. This is theatre!

180
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,430
It's all about fear.

181
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,510
Working hypothesis --

182
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,190
I'm in a fully automated haunted
house. A mechanical maze.

183
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,360
CLATTERING

184
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,070
It's a killer puzzle box
designed to scare me to death,

185
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,660
and I'm trapped inside it.

186
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,310
HE CHUCKLES

187
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,310
Must be Christmas!

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,920

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
FAINT BELLS CHIME

193
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,950
Another spade?

194
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,310
Someone wants me to dig.

195
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,030
What do you think, Clara?

196
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,550
Is someone trying to give me a hint?

197
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,030
- What would you do?
- CHALK TAPS

198
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,880
Yes. Yes, of course you would.

199
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,470
Which, let's be honest,
is what killed you.

200
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,590
So, someone is trying to tell me

201
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,030
that there's something important
buried in this garden.

202
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,750
That's almost the first
thing they tried to tell me.

203
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,230
Could be a trick.

204
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,510
Could be one of my predecessors.

205
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,760
Because I'm not the first
prisoner here, am I?!

206
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
All those skulls!

207
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Wonder where they all went wrong.

208
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,670
Building this height,

209
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,590
creature that slow, so what...?

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,070

So?

223
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,390
It can set traps. That's OK.

224
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,350
I'm good at traps.

225
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,110
So, where are you off to?

226
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,980
Only one way in and one way out.

227
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,710
Well, seeing as you're going...

228
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,430
No, no. That's not right.

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,710
Well, that was another close one.

236
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,110
Or it will have been, once I've been
and gone and got myself out of it.

237
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,710
So, how am I going to do that?

238
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,670
Come on, teacher, ask me questions!

239
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
CHALK TAPS

240
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,340
I'm actually scared of dying.

241
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,520
CHALK TAPS

242
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,670
The truth, yes.

243
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,070
But not any old truth, Clara.

244
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,280
This whole place is designed to
terrify me. I'm being interrogated.

245
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,860
It's not just truth it
wants. That's not enough.

246
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,540
It's confession.

247
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,120
I have to tell truths
I've never told before.

248
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,240
That's the only thing that stops it.

249
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,380
You see, the problem is...

250
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,520
.. Clara...

251
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,020
.. there are truths that I can never tell.

252
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
Not for anything.

253
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,220
But I'm scared and I'm alone.

254
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,640
Alone...

255
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,550
.. and very, very scared.

256
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,350
I confess.

257
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,310
I didn't leave Gallifrey
because I was bored!

258
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,660
That was a lie! It's always been a lie!

259
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,320
Not enough? You want more?

260
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,910
I was scared! I ran because I was scared!

261
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,830
Is that what you want me to
say? Is that true enough for you?

This is how my world works, Clara.

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,550
I tick off the seconds as they pass.

- DOOR THUDS
- My life is a countdown.

277
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,030
If I draw the creature to
one extreme of the castle,

278
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,270
and I run to the other extreme,

279
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,440
I can earn myself a maximum of 82 minutes.

280
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,230
82 minutes to eat,

281

sleep and work.

282
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,350
My work is finding Room 12.

283
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,520
The castle wants me to. It's luring me.

284
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,750
The numbering is a bit confused,

285
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,000
as if the rooms are all jumbled up.

286
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,280
Maybe they move around.

287
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,360
I saw the whole castle move...

288
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,630
.. when I made the creature stop.

289
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,160
HE SIGHS

290
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,190
Every room, if I leave it long enough,

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,340
reverts to its condition
at the moment I arrive.

It tidies up after itself.

Automated room service.

294
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,510
I think this whole place is
inside a closed energy loop,

295
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,830
constantly recycling.

296
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,030
Or maybe I'm in Hell?

297
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,030
That's OK. I'm not scared of Hell.

298
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,020
It's just Heaven for bad people.

DOOR OPENS

307
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,150
There are two events in everybody's
life that nobody remembers,

308
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,910
two moments experienced
by every living thing.

309
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,460
Yet, no-one remembers anything about them.

310
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,030
Nobody remembers being born...

311
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,680
and nobody remembers dying.

312
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,550
Is that why we always stare
into the eye sockets of a skull?

313
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,190
Because we're asking,

314
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,350
"What was it like?

315
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,070
"Does it hurt?

316
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,520
"Are you still scared?"

317
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,110
"Bird"? What's "bird" got to do with it?

318
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,430
Are there birds here?

Hello, is there someone there? Hello!

It's a trap, Clara.

328
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,470
A lure and a trap.

329
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,380
I'm following breadcrumbs laid out for me.

330

This is somebody's game...

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,840
a game everybody else has lost.

333
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,430
I know how to move that wall, Clara,

334
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,270
so long as I don't run out of confessions.

335
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,670
- But what I really want to know is...
- FLIES BUZZ

336
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,270
.. who's been playing
about with the stars?

337
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,630
They're all in the wrong places,

338
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,280
for this time zone, anyway.

339
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,990
I know I didn't time travel to get here.

340
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,870
I can FEEL time travel.

341
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,910
If I didn't know better, I'd
say I've travelled 7,000 years

342
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,900
into the future.

343
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,710
But I do know better.

344
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,870
So, who moved the stars?

345
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,960
FLIES BUZZ LOUDLY

346
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,480
The Hybrid.

347
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,750
Long before the Time War,

348
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,030
the Time Lords knew it was coming,

349
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,550
like a storm on the wind.

350
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,910
There were many prophecies and stories,

351
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,950
legends before the fact.

352
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,400
One of them was about a
creature called the Hybrid.

353
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,110
Half Dalek, half Time Lord --

354
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,070
the ultimate warrior.

355
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,830
But whose side would it be on?

356
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,350
Would it bring peace or destruction?

357
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,630
Was it real, or a fantasy?

358
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,790
I confess,

359
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,310
I know the Hybrid is real.

360
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,990
I know where it is, and what it is.

361
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,190
I confess, I'm afraid.

362
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,960

What else would it be?

369
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,190

00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,510
Always then.

381
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,590
Always... then.

Always EXACTLY then!

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,000
I can't keep doing this, Clara! I can't!

00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,040
Easy. It would be easy.

389
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,510
It would be SO easy.

390
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,590
Just tell them.

391
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,160
Just tell them, whoever wants
to know, all about the Hybrid.

I can't...

395
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,840
I can't always do this!

396
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,190
It's not fair!

397
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,910
Clara, it's just not fair!

398
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,360
Why can't I just lose?!

399
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,900
But I can remember, Clara.

400
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,190
You don't understand,

401
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,580
I can remember it all.

402
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,710
Every time.

403
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,830
And you'll still be gone.

404
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,540
Whatever I do...

405
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,870
.. you still won't be there.

406
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,860
Doctor...

407
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,670
.. you are not the only
person who ever lost someone.

408
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,510
It's the story of everybody.

409
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,870
Get over it.

410
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,760
Beat it.

411
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,630
Break free.

412
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,590
Doctor, it's time.

413
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,350
Get up, off your arse...

414
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,390
.. and win!

415
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,950
Hello again.

416
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,750

But I will tell you... the truth.

419
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,960
HE SCREAMS

420
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,950
The Hybrid is a very dangerous secret.

421
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,950
A very, very dangerous secret
and it needs to be kept!

422
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,540
HE SHOUTS

423
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,080
So, I'm telling you
nothing. Nothing at all.

424
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,960
Instead, I'm going to
do something far worse.

425
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,720
Argh!

426
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,350
I'm going to get out of here,

427
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,350
and find whoever put me
here in the first place,

428
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,190
and whatever they're trying to
do, I'm going to... stop it!

429
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,800
Argh!

FOOTSTEPS THUD

But it might take me a little while,

432
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,880
so do you want me to tell you a story?

433
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,670
The Brothers Grimm, lovely fellas...

434
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,150
They're on my darts team.

435
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,470
Argh!

436
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,030
According to them,

437
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,950
there's this emperor

438
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,360
and he asks this shepherd's boy...

439
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,320

can take days.

453
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,280
That's why we like to

.. it'll take me about a day and a half

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,990
It's the only way.

465
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,880
I have to be strong.

466
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,790
I should have known
from the very beginning.

467
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,480
Of course.

468
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,190
The portrait of you,

469
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,440
the creature from my own nightmares...

470
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,240
This place is my own,
bespoke torture chamber...

471
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,470
.. intended for me only,

472
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,920
and all those skulls in the water...

473
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,560
How could there be other
prisoners... in my hell?

474
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,150
The answer, of course,

475
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,240
is there never were any other prisoners.

476
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,900
And the stars...

477
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,420
They weren't in the wrong place...

478
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,940
.. and I haven't time travelled.

479
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,550
I've just been here

480

Every room resets.

00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,030
Remember I told you that?

483
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,070
Every room reverts to
its original condition.

484
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:11,190
Logically, the teleporter
should do the same.

485
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,110
"Teleporter" -- fancy word.

486
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,630
Just like 3D printers, really,

487
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,880
except they break down living matter
and information, and transmit it.

488
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,200
All you have to do is add energy.

489
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,510
The room has reset,

490
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,830
returned to its original
condition when I arrived.

491
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,790
That means there's a copy of me

492
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,310
still in the hard drive.

493
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,920

494
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,160

495
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,420
.. 7,000 years ago.

496
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,080
All I have to find is some energy.

497
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,200
And all you need for energy...

498
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,550
.. is something to burn.

If you think because
she's dead, I am weak,

510
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,660
then you understand very little.

511
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,030
If you were any part of killing
her and you're not afraid,

512
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,190
then you understand nothing at all.

513
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,030
So, for your own sake, understand this.

I'm the Doctor. I'm coming to find you,

00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,630
The Hybrid is a creature
