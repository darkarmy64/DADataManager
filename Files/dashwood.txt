If you can hear this, you're alone.
The only thing left of us is the sound of my voice.
I don't know if any of us made it.
Did we win? Did we lose?
I don't know.
But either way, it's over.
So let me tell you who we were.
Let me tell you who you are...
Someone once asked me if I had learned anything from it all.
So let me tell you what I learned.

I learned everyone dies alone.
But if you mean something to someone,
If you helped someone...
Or loved someone...
If even a single person remembers you...
Then maybe you never really die.
And maybe... this isn't the end at all.
